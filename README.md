> ⚠️ Disclaimer: I’m not a Neovim guru. This is just how I use Neovim personally. It works for me, but may need adjustments for your setup.

## Requirements

- fd
- ripgrep

## Installation

Clone this repository into your Neovim configuration directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parsajokar/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim

```
